In three semesters, I have done only a few projects. One of them was a Dynamic Quiz Generator, which we created using OOP. In the Dynamic Quiz Generator, we also implemented file handling.In Software Engineering, we worked on a game based on Virtual Reality, but we didnâ€™t do the coding for it. Instead, we worked on test cases, functional and non-functional requirements, etc.
